# Coordinates "Spreadsheet"

This is an example of how you can use an array of arrays to keep track of coordinates.

It allows you to create a "spreadsheet" where each "row" is a different stage of the sketch. 
Each row contains a list of coordinates for the circles that will appear in that stage.

Look at the "circles" branch to see an example where each "cell" of the spreadsheet contains an object instead of just a pair of xy coordinates.
That version allows you to specify additional properties for each item - in the example, I define the color of each circle.
